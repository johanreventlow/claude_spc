\title{Reactive Batching Utilities}
\description{
This file provides utilities for batching rapid-fire reactive events to
reduce reactive storm overhead and improve performance.
}
\details{
\subsection{Performance Optimization}{

Batching prevents reactive storms by delaying event emission until a quiet
period occurs. This is particularly effective for:
\itemize{
\item Column input changes that trigger multiple downstream updates
\item UI sync requests that may fire in rapid succession
\item Any event that tends to fire multiple times in quick succession
}
}

\subsection{Implementation Strategy}{

Uses \code{later::later()} to schedule deferred execution. If another event
arrives before the timeout, the previous schedule is preserved (not reset).
This ensures the first event in a burst triggers execution after the delay.
