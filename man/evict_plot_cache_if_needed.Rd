\title{K7 FIX: Evict Plot Cache Entries to Enforce Limits}
\usage{
evict_plot_cache_if_needed()
}
\description{
Remove expired entries and enforce size limits to prevent unbounded growth.
Uses LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction when over capacity.
}
\details{
Without eviction, .plot_cache_env accumulates full data frames (â‰ˆ2.3 MB each)
and ggplot objects indefinitely. This function:
\enumerate{
\item Removes expired entries (read-through cleanup)
\item Enforces max entry count (LRU eviction)
\item Enforces max total size (LRU eviction)
}

Should be called:
\itemize{
\item Before adding new entries (set_plot_cache)
\item Periodically via background task (setup_plot_cache_maintenance)
}
}
