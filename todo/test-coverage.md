Executive Summary

  - Could not compute package coverage automatically: Rscript tests/coverage.R fails because covr is not installed in
    this environment. Manual review indicates several core paths (startup, dependency loading, state accessors) have no
    executable tests.
  - Critical gaps: untested startup optimization flow (R/app_run.R:151), dependency loader and safe load fallbacks
    (R/app_dependencies.R:13–R/app_dependencies.R:200), and state accessor layer (R/utils_state_accessors.R:45–R/
    utils_state_accessors.R:195) leave data load and state sync exposed.
  - Test suite health score: 6/10 — breadth is impressive, but numerous files rely on skipped/performance suites,
    several “comprehensive” specs contain no real assertions, and timing-heavy tests introduce flake risk.

  Coverage Gaps

  - R/utils_state_accessors.R:45 — Risk Level: Critical; Gap Type: Untested code path (all getters/setters).
    Recommendation: add unit tests using a fresh create_app_state() to exercise each accessor (including set_* error
    handling) so state sync invariants stay guarded.
  - R/app_run.R:151 — Risk Level: Critical; Gap Type: Untested fallback/error handling. Recommendation: write tests
    (with with_mocked_bindings) covering the branches where cache_startup_data() succeeds, fails, and when lazy loading
    is unavailable to ensure startup degrades gracefully.
  - R/app_dependencies.R:13 — Risk Level: High; Gap Type: Untested code path + missing error assertions. Recommendation:
    unit-test manage_app_dependencies()/safe_load_package() with mocked requireNamespace to confirm required packages
    stop the app, optional packages warn, and production threading tweaks apply.
  - tests/testthat/test-mod-spc-chart-integration.R:92 — Risk Level: High; Gap Type: Untested reactive chain
    (visualization module). Recommendation: replace placeholder testServer() blocks with assertions on session$output/
    cache flags so chart generation, guards, and race-prevention logic are verified.
  - R/utils_performance_monitoring.R:63 — Risk Level: Medium; Gap Type: Untested code path. Recommendation: create
    fast tests that stub Sys.sleep() and the global counters so monitor_startup_performance() and track_* APIs report
    deterministic metrics without 30‑second delays.

  Missing Edge Cases

  - Scenario: CSV uploads exceeding the 50 000 row guard (R/fct_file_operations.R:667). Example: synthetic file with
    60 001 rows should add the “for many rows” error. Test Template:

    test_that("validate_uploaded_file rejects CSV above row limit", {
      csv <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv")
      on.exit(unlink(csv), add = TRUE)
      writeLines(c("x", rep("1", 60001)), csv)
      info <- list(name = basename(csv), size = file.info(csv)$size,
                   type = "text/csv", datapath = csv)
      result <- validate_uploaded_file(info)
      expect_false(result$valid)
      expect_true(any(grepl("50,000", result$errors)))
    })
  - Scenario: Production tuning in setup_performance_packages() should drop threads/raise thresholds (R/
    app_dependencies.R:197). Example: config with environment$is_production <- TRUE should yield debounce$input_change
    == 500 and thresholds$reactive_warning == 1.0. Test Template:

    test_that("setup_performance_packages applies production tuning", {
      config <- list(environment = list(is_production = TRUE, is_development = FALSE))
      perf <- setup_performance_packages(config)
      expect_equal(perf$debounce$input_change, 500)
      expect_equal(perf$thresholds$reactive_warning, 1.0)
    })
  - Scenario: Startup optimization fallback when caching fails (R/app_run.R:192). Example: cache_startup_data() raising
    an error should flip the startup_optimization_failed log but still return FALSE. Test Template:

    test_that("initialize_startup_performance_optimizations tolerates cache errors", {
      with_mock(
        cache_startup_data = function() stop("boom"),
        load_cached_startup_data = function() list(),
        lazy_load_modules = function(...) character(0),
        {
          expect_false(initialize_startup_performance_optimizations())
        }
      )
    })

  Test Quality Issues

  - tests/testthat/test-runtime-config-comprehensive.R:19: still asserts config$test_mode even though
    initialize_runtime_config() now returns config$testing; results are either failing or masking regressions. Align
    expectations with current data contract and explicitly assert the legacy alias if required.
  - tests/testthat/test-mod-spc-chart-integration.R:92: multiple it() blocks contain only comments or skip() calls,
    so critical visualization observers are effectively untested. Flesh these out with real expect_* checks or move
    unfinished specs to TODOs to avoid false confidence.
  - tests/testthat/test-logging-standardization.R:13: first block is hard-skipped, and the rest merely expect_no_error
    without verifying structured output or detail fields. Strengthen assertions (e.g., regex on formatted message,
    inspection of log_debug_kv() key/value capture).

  Flaky Test Report

  - tests/testthat/test-cache-invalidation-sprint3.R:80 — Symptoms: 2‑second Sys.sleep() while waiting for cache
    expiry; slow environments can still be mid-sleep. Root Cause: real clock dependence. Fix: stub the clock via
    withr::local_time() or inject a now() parameter so expiry can be simulated instantly.
  - tests/testthat/test-event-bus-full-chain.R:201 — Symptoms: multiple Sys.sleep(0.2) to allow observers to fire;
    occasionally races on busy CI. Root Cause: reliance on wall-clock instead of flushReact() loops. Fix: poll on the
    expected event length with a small retry loop rather than fixed sleeps.
  - tests/performance/test_startup_performance.R:44 — Symptoms: unconditional 30‑second sleep when script runs non-
    interactively, which will stall CI if invoked. Root Cause: script auto-executes test_startup_performance() on
    sourcing. Fix: guard the runner behind if (identical(Sys.getenv("SPC_RUN_PERF"), "true")) or similar flag.

  Integration & E2E Coverage

  - Covered Workflows: File upload sanitization (tests/testthat/test-file-operations.R), QIC prep and plot generation
    (tests/testthat/test-spc-plot-generation-comprehensive.R), event bus regression chains (tests/testthat/test-event-
    bus-full-chain.R), and cache invalidation (tests/testthat/test-cache-reactive-lazy-evaluation.R) provide reasonable
    functional coverage for data load and plot computation.
  - Missing Workflows: Real Shiny module rendering for visualizationModuleServer (test stubs never assert outputs),
    resume/restore flows for session_reset and test mode sequencing, and file export/download journeys (no
    downloadHandler tests) are absent. End-to-end journeys via shinytest2 are skipped on CI (tests/testthat/test-app-
    basic.R:44, tests/testthat/test-e2e-user-workflows.R:14) and require local shinytest2 installation.
  - Priority Additions: 1) Add a deterministic testServer() suite that drives visualizationModuleServer through
    data/update/ui_sync, asserting cached plot objects and warning propagation. 2) Build integration tests for
    initialize_test_mode()/set_test_mode_* to confirm event emissions and state flags across sessions. 3) Introduce
    headless shinytest2 snapshots for upload→chart→export workflow using the mock AppDriver so CI exercises critical
    UX paths.

  Action Plan

  - Add focused unit tests for the state accessor module (R/utils_state_accessors.R) covering getters/setters, invalid
    inputs, and timestamp updates (Effort: M).
  - Create startup optimization test harnesses that mock cache/lazy-loading collaborators and assert success/failure
    logging (R/app_run.R:151, R/utils_startup_cache.R:40) (Effort: M).
  - Refactor tests/testthat/test-mod-spc-chart-integration.R into real assertions with deterministic fixtures (Effort:
    M).
  - Update runtime config tests to match the current schema and add new assertions for legacy aliasing to prevent
    regressions (tests/testthat/test-runtime-config-comprehensive.R:19) (Effort: S).
  - Stabilize time-dependent specs by replacing Sys.sleep() with reactive polling or clock injection, starting with
    cache expiry and event chain tests (Effort: M).

  Next steps after addressing the above: rerun Rscript tests/coverage.R once covr is available to validate improvements
  and ensure critical-path coverage meets the 100 % target.
