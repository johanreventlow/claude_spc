Critical Issues

  - log_error() rejects show_user everywhere it is called with that argument, so the first file-upload validation
    error will throw unused argument (show_user = FALSE) instead of writing a log (R/fct_file_operations.R:15, R/
    fct_file_operations.R:33, R/fct_file_operations.R:67). This blocks error-path logging and breaks the defensive
    upload guardrail.
  - The logging API still lacks the session parameter required by your observability spec; every exported
    helper (log_info, log_warn, log_error, log_debug) omits it (R/utils_logging.R:243, R/utils_logging.R:279, R/
    utils_logging.R:320). Call sites that try to pass session (e.g. via safe_operation) silently drop the context, so
    logs cannot be correlated per user.

  High Priority

  - log_debug() only honours .context and ignores the (well-documented) component argument; it collapses all args into
    the message and defaults the component to UNSPECIFIED (R/utils_logging.R:193-207). Because of this, 260 of 422
    debug calls fall back to [UNSPECIFIED], including hot paths such as prepare_qic_data_parameters() and lazy-loader
    metrics (R/fct_spc_plot_generation.R:263, R/utils_lazy_loading.R:94, R/utils_performance_monitoring.R:188). Result:
    filtering by component is impossible for most debug telemetry.
  - Non-debug levels also have gaps: 43 of 58 log_info() calls and 51 of 56 log_error() calls rely on bare messages
    without .context or component, leaving production-grade events untagged (e.g. R/utils_microbenchmark.R:638, R/
    utils_microbenchmark.R:642, R/utils_microbenchmark.R:181). These land in UNSPECIFIED, defeating component-based
    alerting.
  - Structured details are flattened into a concatenated string before reaching log_msg, so downstream systems cannot
    parse key/value metadata (R/utils_logging.R:248-259, R/utils_logging.R:292-303, R/utils_logging.R:331-342). Even the
    few call sites that supply details—mostly file upload security checks—lose their structure.
  - The advanced debug channel bypasses the central API entirely: debug_log() writes straight to stdout with cat() (R/
    utils_advanced_debug.R:64-104). Any workflow using it (session lifecycle tracing, workflow tracer, performance
    timers) is invisible to centralized collectors.

  Medium Priority

  - Startup/performance tooling prints large summaries with raw cat() rather than issuing structured logs (R/
    utils_performance_monitoring.R:330-370), so those insights never reach log aggregation.
  - Context strings are repeatedly hard-coded instead of reusing LOG_CONTEXTS; several typos already exist
    (“PERFORMANCE_MONITORING”, “[BENCHMARK]”, etc.), raising drift risk (R/utils_lazy_loading.R:101, R/
    utils_performance_monitoring.R:188, R/utils_microbenchmark.R:55).
  - High-frequency trackers (track_qic_call, track_generateSPCPlot_call, track_event) emit unconditional debug logs on
    every invocation (R/utils_performance_monitoring.R:187-211), which will flood log volume once instrumentation is
    enabled unless they accept a throttle or configurable level.

  Coverage Metrics

  - Log helpers in repo (excl. definitions): log_debug 422, log_info 58, log_warn 106, log_error 56.
  - .context usage: debug 162/422 (38%); info 15/58 (26%); warn 18/106 (17%); error 5/56 (9%).
  - details usage: exactly 3 production calls across all levels, each flattened before output.
  - Raw cat( occurrences in R/: 58 (print methods, debug utilities, performance summaries).

  Strengths

  - File upload security paths already provide rich metadata in details (once the logger keeps it) and sanitize session
    tokens before logging (R/fct_file_operations.R:15-76).
  - LOG_CONTEXTS offers a solid taxonomy that can be reused once call sites adopt it consistently.

  Recommendations

  1. Extend the logging API to accept session, optional show_user, and a genuine component parameter, then refactor
     callers—starting with file upload guards—to pass structured details without breaking.
  2. Audit all logging calls: replace positional strings with .context = LOG_CONTEXTS$…, and remove log_debug(...,
     "CONTEXT") patterns that currently lose their tag.
  3. Preserve structure by emitting details as JSON or named list objects (e.g. hand them straight to log_msg and let
     the sink serialize), and run a migration for existing paste()-based messages.
  4. Fold debug_log() into the central pipeline (or wrap it) so advanced tracing shares the same transport, filtering,
     and correlation IDs.

  Next steps you may want to queue up: 1) fix the log_error() signature/usage mismatch before the next upload test run;
  2) capture a shortlist of high-traffic modules (lazy loading, performance trackers) and convert their debug calls to
  proper contexts; 3) rerun R -e "library(SPCify); testthat::test_dir('tests/testthat')" once the API changes are in to
  confirm nothing else regressed.
